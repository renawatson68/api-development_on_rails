== Placing Orders

Back in previous chapter we handle associations between the product and user models, and how to serialize them in order to scale fast and easy. Now it is time to start placing orders which is going to be a more complex situation, because we will handle associations between 3 models and we have to be smart enough to handle the JSON output we are delivering.

In this chapter we will make several things which I list below:

[arabic]
. Create an `Order` model with its corresponding specs
. Handle JSON output association between the order user and product models
. Send a confirmation email with the order summary

So now that we have everything clear, we can get our hands dirty. You can clone the project up to this point with:

[source,bash]
----
$ git clone --branch chapter7 https://github.com/madeindjs/market_place_api
----

Let’s create a branch to start working:

[source,bash]
----
$ git checkout -b chapter8
----

=== Modeling the order

If you remember associations model, the `Order` model is associated with users and products at the same time, it is actually really simply to achieve this in Rails. The tricky part is whens comes to serializing this objects. I talk about more about this in a next section.

Let’s start by creating the order model, with a special form:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails generate model order user:references total:decimal
----

The command above will generate the order model, but I’m taking advantage of the `references` method to create the corresponding foreign key for the order to belong to a user, it also adds the `belongs_to` directive into the order model. Let’s migrate the database and jump into the `order_spec.rb` file.

[source,bash]
----
$ rake db:migrate
----

Now it is time to drop some tests into the `order_spec.rb` file:

[source,ruby]
.spec/models/order_spec.rb
----
# ...
RSpec.describe Order, type: :model do
  let(:order) { FactoryBot.build :order }
  subject { order }

  it { should respond_to(:total) }
  it { should respond_to(:user_id) }

  it { should validate_presence_of :user_id }
  it { should validate_presence_of :total }
  it { should validate_numericality_of(:total).is_greater_than_or_equal_to(0) }

  it { should belong_to :user }
end
----

The implementation is fairly simple:

[source,ruby]
.app/models/order.rb
----
class Order < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user
  validates :total, numericality: { greater_than_or_equal_to: 0 }
  validates :total, presence: true
  validates :user_id, presence: true
end
----

If we run the tests now, they should be all green:

[source,bash]
----
$ rspec spec/models/order_spec.rb
......

Finished in 0.16229 seconds (files took 4.08 seconds to load)
6 examples, 0 failures
----

==== Orders and Products

We need to setup the association between the `order` and the `product`, and this is build with a `has-many-to-many` association, as many products will be placed on many orders and the orders will have multiple products. So in this case we need a model in the middle which will join these two other objects and map the appropiate association.

Let’s generate this model:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails generate model placement order:references product:references
----

Let’s migrate the database:

[source,bash]
----
$ rake db:migrate
----

Let’s add the order association specs first:

[source,ruby]
.spec/models/order_spec.rb
----
# ...
RSpec.describe Order, type: :model do
  # ...
  it { should have_many(:placements) }
  it { should have_many(:products).through(:placements) }
end
----

The implementation is like so:

[source,ruby]
.app/models/order.rb
----
class Order < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :placements
  has_many :products, through: :placements
  # ...
end
----

Now it is time to jump into the `product-placement` association:

[source,ruby]
.spec/models/product_spec.rb
----
# ...
RSpec.describe Product, type: :model do
  # ...
  it { should have_many(:placements) }
  it { should have_many(:orders).through(:placements) }
  # ...
end
----

Let’s add the code to make it pass:

[source,ruby]
.app/models/product.rb
----
class Product < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user
  has_many :placements
  has_many :orders, through: :placements
  # ...
end
----

And lastly but not least, the `placement` specs:

[source,ruby]
.spec/models/placement_spec.rb
----
# ...
RSpec.describe Placement, type: :model do
  let(:placement) { FactoryBot.build :placement }
  subject { placement }

  it { should respond_to :order_id }
  it { should respond_to :product_id }

  it { should belong_to :order }
  it { should belong_to :product }
end
----

If you have been following the tutorial so far, the implementation is already there, because of the `references` type we pass on the model command generator. We should add the inverse option to the `placement` model for each `belongs_to` call. This gives a little boost when referencing the parent object.

[source,ruby]
.app/models/placement.rb
----
class Placement < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :order, inverse_of: :placements
  belongs_to :product, inverse_of: :placements
end
----

Let’s run the `models` spec and make sure everything is green:

[source,bash]
----
$ rspec spec/models
...........................................

Finished in 0.53127 seconds (files took 0.73125 seconds to load)
43 examples, 0 failures
----

Now that everything is nice and green, let’s commit the changes and continue.

[source,bash]
----
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Associates products and orders with a placements model"
----

=== User orders

We are just missing one little but very important part, which is to relate the user to the orders. But we did no complete the implementation. So let’s do that. First open the `user_model_spec.rb` file to add the corresponding tests:

[source,ruby]
.spec/models/user_spec.rb
----
# ...
RSpec.describe User, type: :model do
  # ...
  it { should have_many(:orders) }
  # ...
end
----

And then just add the implementation, which is super simple:

[source,ruby]
.app/models/user.rb
----
class User < ApplicationRecord
  # ...
  has_many :orders, dependent: :destroy
  # ...
end
----

You can run the tests for both files, and they should be all nice and green:

[source,bash]
----
$ rspec spec/models/{order,user}_spec.rb
....................

Finished in 0.14279 seconds (files took 0.72848 seconds to load)
20 examples, 0 failures
----

Let’s commit this small changes and move next:

[source,bash]
----
$ git add .
$ git commit -m 'Adds user order has many relation'
----

=== Exposing the order model

It is now time to prepare the orders controller to expose the correct order object, and if you recall past chapters, with https://github.com/rails-api/active_model_serializers[ActiveModelSerializers] this is really easy.

> But wait, what are we suppose to expose?

.. You may be wondering. And you are right. Let’s first define which actions are we going to build up:

[arabic]
. An index action to retrieve the current user orders
. A show action to retrieve a particular order from the current user
. A create action to actually place the order

Let’s start with the `index` action, so first we have to create the orders controller.

[source,bash]
----
$ rails g controller api/v1/orders
----

Up to this point and before start typing some code, we have to ask ourselves, should I leave my order endpoints nested into the `UsersController`, or should I isolate them, and the answer is really simple. I would say it depends on how much information in this case in particular you want to expose to the developer, not from a json output point of view, but from the URI format.

I’ll nest the routes, because I like to give this type of information to the developers, as I think it gives more context to the request itself. Let’s start by dropping some tests:

[source,ruby]
.spec/controllers/api/v1/orders_controller_spec.rb
----
# ...
RSpec.describe Api::V1::OrdersController, type: :controller do
  describe 'GET #index' do
    before(:each) do
      current_user = FactoryBot.create :user
      api_authorization_header current_user.auth_token
      4.times { FactoryBot.create :order, user: current_user }
      get :index, params: { user_id: current_user.id }
    end

    it 'returns 4 order records from the user' do
      expect(json_response).to have(4).items
    end

    it { expect(response.response_code).to eq(200) }
  end
end
----

If we run the test suite now, as you may expect, both tests will fail, because have not even set the correct routes, nor the action. So let’s start by adding the routes:

[source,ruby]
.config/routes.rb
----
# ...
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  # ...
  namespace :api, defaults: { format: :json }, constraints: { subdomain: 'api' }, path: '/' do
    scope module: :v1, constraints: ApiConstraints.new(version: 1, default: true) do
      resources :users, only: %i[show create update destroy] do
        # ...
        resources :orders, only: [:index]
      end
      # ...
    end
  end
end
----

Now it is time for the orders controller implementation:

[source,ruby]
.app/controllers/api/v1/orders_controller.rb
----
class Api::V1::OrdersController < ApplicationController
  before_action :authenticate_with_token!

  def index
    render json: current_user.orders
  end
end
----

And now all of our tests should pass:

[source,bash]
----
$ rspec spec/controllers/api/v1/orders_controller_spec.rb
..

Finished in 0.07943 seconds (files took 0.7232 seconds to load)
2 examples, 0 failures
----

We like our commits very atomic, so let’s commit this changes:

[source,bash]
----
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Adds the show action for order"
----

==== Render a single order

As you may imagine already, this endpoint is super easy, we just have to set up some configuration(routes, controller action) and that would be it for this section.

Let’s start by adding some specs:

[source,ruby]
.spec/controllers/api/v1/orders_controller_spec.rb
----
# ...
RSpec.describe Api::V1::OrdersController, type: :controller do
  # ...
  describe 'GET #show' do
    before(:each) do
      current_user = FactoryBot.create :user
      api_authorization_header current_user.auth_token
      @order = FactoryBot.create :order, user: current_user
      get :show, params: { user_id: current_user.id, id: @order.id }
    end

    it 'returns the user order record matching the id' do
      expect(json_response[:id]).to eql @order.id
    end

    it { expect(response.response_code).to eq(200) }
  end
end
----

Let’s add the implementation to make our tests pass. On the `routes.rb` file add the show action to the orders resources:

[source,ruby]
.config/routes.rb
----
# ...
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  # ...
  resources :orders, only: [:index, :show]
  # ...
end
----

And the the implementation should look like this:

[source,ruby]
.app/controllers/api/v1/orders_controller.rb
----
class Api::V1::OrdersController < ApplicationController
  # ...
  def show
    render json: current_user.orders.find(params[:id])
  end
end
----

Our tests should be all green:

[source,bash]
----
$ rspec spec/controllers/api/v1/orders_controller_spec.rb
....

Finished in 0.12767 seconds (files took 0.73322 seconds to load)
4 examples, 0 failures
----

Let’s commit the changes and move onto the create order action:

[source,bash]
----
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Adds the show action for order"
----

==== Placing and order

It is now time to let the user place some orders, this will add some complexity to the whole application, but don’t worry we will go one step at a time to keep things simple.

Before start this feature, let’s sit back and think about the implications of creating an order in the app. I’m not talking about implementing a transactions service like https://stripe.com/[Stripe] or https://www.braintreepayments.com/[Braintree], but things like handling out of stock products, decrementing the product inventory, add some validation for the order placement to make sure there is enough products by the time the order is place. Did you already detected that?, it may look like we are way down on the hill, but believe, you are closer than you think, and is not as hard as it sounds.

For now let’s keep things simple an assume we always have enough products to place any number of orders, we just care about the server response for now.

If you recall the `order` model on http://apionrails.icalialabs.com/book/chapter_eight#sec-modeling_order[Section 8.1] we need basically 3 things, a total for the order, the user who is placing the order and the products for the order. Given that information we can start adding some specs:

[source,ruby]
.spec/controllers/api/v1/orders_controller_spec.rb
----
# ...
RSpec.describe Api::V1::OrdersController, type: :controller do
  # ...
  describe 'POST #create' do
    before(:each) do
      current_user = FactoryBot.create :user
      api_authorization_header current_user.auth_token

      product_1 = FactoryBot.create :product
      product_2 = FactoryBot.create :product
      order_params = { total: 50, user_id: current_user.id, product_ids: [product_1.id, product_2.id] }
      post :create, params: { user_id: current_user.id, order: order_params }
    end

    it 'returns the just user order record' do
      expect(json_response[:id]).to be_present
    end

    it { expect(response.response_code).to eq(201) }
  end
end
----

As you can see we are creating a `order_params` variable with the order data, can you see the problem here?, if not, I’ll explain it later, let’s just add the necessary code to make this test pass.

First we need to add the action to the resources on the routes file:

[source,ruby]
.config/routes.rb
----
# ...
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  # ...
  resources :orders, only: %i[index show create]
  # ...
end
----

Then the implementation which is easy:

[source,ruby]
.app/controllers/api/v1/orders_controller.rb
----
class Api::V1::OrdersController < ApplicationController
  # ...
  def create
    order = current_user.orders.build(order_params)

    if order.save
      render json: order, status: 201, location: [:api, current_user, order]
    else
      render json: { errors: order.errors }, status: 422
    end
  end

  private

  def order_params
    params.require(:order).permit(:total, :user_id, product_ids: [])
  end
end
----

And now our tests should all be green:

[source,bash]
----
$ rspec spec/controllers/api/v1/orders_controller_spec.rb
......

Finished in 0.16817 seconds (files took 0.64624 seconds to load)
6 examples, 0 failures
----

Ok, so we have everything nice and green. We now should move on to the next chapter right?, well let me stop you right there, we have some serious errors on the app, and they are not related to the code itself but on the business part.

Not because the tests are green, it means the app is filling the business part of the app, and I wanted to bring this up, because in many cases is super easy to just receive params, and build objects from those params, thinking that we are always receiving the correct data. In this particular case we cannot rely on that, and the simpliest way to see this, is that we are letting the client to set the order total, yeah crazy!

We have to add some validations, or better said a callback to calculate the order total an set it through the model. This way we don’t longer receive that total attribute and have complete control on this attribute. So let’s do that.

We first need to add some specs for the order model:

[source,ruby]
.spec/models/order_spec.rb
----
# ...
RSpec.describe Order, type: :model do
  # ...
  describe '#set_total!' do
    before(:each) do
      product_1 = FactoryBot.create :product, price: 100
      product_2 = FactoryBot.create :product, price: 85

      @order = FactoryBot.build :order, product_ids: [product_1.id, product_2.id]
    end

    it 'returns the total amount to pay for the products' do
      expect { @order.set_total! }.to change { @order.total }.from(0).to(185)
    end
  end
end
----

We can now add the implementation:

[source,ruby]
.app/models/order.rb
----
class Order < ApplicationRecord
  # ...
  def set_total!
    self.total = products.map(&:price).sum
  end
end
----

Just before you run your tests, we need to update the `order` factory, just to make it more useful:

[source,ruby]
.spec/factories/orders.rb
----
FactoryBot.define do
  factory :order do
    user { nil }
    total { 0.0 }
  end
end
----

We can now hook the `set_total!` method to a `before_validation` callback to make sure it has the correct total before is validated.

[source,ruby]
.app/models/order.rb
----
class Order < ApplicationRecord
  before_validation :set_total!
  # ...
end
----

At this point, we are making sure the total is always present and bigger or equal to zero, meaning we can remove those validations and remove the specs. I’ll wait. Our tests should be passing by now:

[source,bash]
----
$ rspec spec/models/order_spec.rb
.........

Finished in 0.06807 seconds (files took 0.66165 seconds to load)
9 examples, 0 failures
----

This is now the moment to visit the `orders_controller_spec.rb` file and refactor some code. Currently we have something like:

[source,ruby]
.spec/controllers/api/v1/orders_controller_spec.rb
----
# ...
RSpec.describe Api::V1::OrdersController, type: :controller do
  # ...
  describe 'POST #create' do
    before(:each) do
      current_user = FactoryBot.create :user
      api_authorization_header current_user.auth_token

      product_1 = FactoryBot.create :product
      product_2 = FactoryBot.create :product
      order_params = { total: 50, user_id: current_user.id, product_ids: [product_1.id, product_2.id] }
      post :create, params: { user_id: current_user.id, order: order_params }
    end

    it 'returns the just user order record' do
      expect(json_response[:id]).to be_present
    end

    it { expect(response.response_code).to eq(201) }
  end
end
----

If you run the tests now, they will pass, but first, let’s remove the `total` and `user_id` from the permitted params and avoid the mass-assignment. The `order_params` method should look like this:

[source,ruby]
.spec/controllers/api/v1/orders_controller_spec.rb
----
# ...
RSpec.describe Api::V1::OrdersController, type: :controller do
  # ...

  describe 'POST #create' do
    before(:each) do
      current_user = FactoryBot.create :user
      api_authorization_header current_user.auth_token

      product_1 = FactoryBot.create :product
      product_2 = FactoryBot.create :product
      # changes heres
      order_params = { product_ids: [product_1.id, product_2.id] }
      post :create, params: { user_id: current_user.id, order: order_params }
    end

    it 'returns the just user order record' do
      expect(json_response[:id]).to be_present
    end

    it { expect(response.response_code).to eq(201) }
  end
end
----

If you run the tests now, they will pass, but first, let’s remove the `total` and `user_id` from the permitted params and avoid the mass-assignment. The `order_params` method should look like this:

[source,ruby]
.app/controllers/api/v1/orders_controller.rb
----
class Api::V1::OrdersController < ApplicationController
  # ...
  private

  def order_params
    params.require(:order).permit(product_ids: [])
  end
end
----

Your tests should still passing:

[source,bash]
----
$ git commit -am "Adds the create method for the orders controller"
----

Let’s commit the changes:

[source,bash]
----
$ git commit -am "Adds the create method for the orders controller"
----

=== Customizing the Order json output

Now that we built the necessary endpoints for the orders, we can customize the information we want to render on the JSON output for each order.

If you remember previous chapter we also use Active Model Serializers gem now. Let’s generate a brand new serializer:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails generate serializer order
----

Now let’s open `order_serializer.rb` who should looks like:

[source,ruby]
.app/serializers/order_serializer.rb
----
class OrderSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
  attributes :id
end
----

We will add the products association and the total attribute to the order output, and to make sure everything is running smooth, we will some specs. In order to avoid duplication on tests, I’ll just add one spec for the `show` and make sure the extra data is being rendered, this is because I’m using the same serializer everytime an order object is being parsed to json, so in this case I would say it is just fine:

[source,ruby]
.spec/controllers/api/v1/orders_controller_spec.rb
----
# ...
RSpec.describe Api::V1::OrdersController, type: :controller do
  # ...
  describe 'GET #show' do
    before(:each) do
      current_user = FactoryBot.create :user
      api_authorization_header current_user.auth_token
      @order = FactoryGirl.create :order, user: current_user, product_ids: [@product.id]
      get :show, params: { user_id: current_user.id, id: @order.id }
    end

    it 'returns the user order record matching the id' do
      expect(json_response[:id]).to eql @order.id
    end

    it 'includes the total for the order' do
      expect(json_response[:total]).to eql @order.total.to_s
    end

    it 'includes the products on the order' do
      expect(json_response[:products]).to have(1).item
    end
    # ...
  end
  # ...
end
----

By now we should have failing tests. But they are easy to fix on the order serializer

[source,ruby]
.app/serializers/order_serializer.rb
----
class OrderSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
  attributes :id, :total
  has_many :products
end
----

And now all of our tests should be green:

[source,bash]
----
$ rspec spec/controllers/api/v1/orders_controller_spec.rb
........

Finished in 0.22865 seconds (files took 0.70506 seconds to load)
8 examples, 0 failures
----

If you recall previous chapter, we embeded the user into the product, in order to retrieve some information, but in this we always know the user, because is actually the `current_user` so there is no point on adding it, it is not efficient, so let’s fix that by adding a new serializer:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails g serializer order_product
----

We want to keep the products information consistent with the one we currently have, so we can just inherit behavior from it like so:

[source,ruby]
.app/serializers/order_product_serializer.rb
----
class OrderProductSerializer < OrderSerializer
end
----

This will keep rendered data on sync, and now to remove the embebed user we simply add the following method on the gem documentation. For more information visit https://github.com/rails-api/active_model_serializers/tree/0-8-stable#associations[ActiveModelSerializer]:

[source,ruby]
.app/serializers/order_product_serializer.rb
----
class OrderProductSerializer < ProductSerializer
  def include_user?
    false
  end
end
----

After making this change we need to tell the `order_serializer` to use the serializer we just created by just passing an option to the `has_many` association on the `order_serializer`:

[source,ruby]
.app/serializers/order_product_serializer.rb
----
class OrderProductSerializer < ProductSerializer
  def include_user?
    false
  end
end
----

And our tests should still passing:

[source,bash]
----
$ rspec spec/controllers/api/v1/orders_controller_spec.rb
........

Finished in 0.24024 seconds (files took 0.70072 seconds to load)
8 examples, 0 failures
----

Let’s commit this and move onto the next section:

[source,bash]
----
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Adds a custom order product serializer to remove the user association"
----

=== Send order confirmation email

The last section for this chapter will be to sent a confirmation email for the user who just placed it. If you want to skip this and jump into the next chapter go ahead. This section is more like a warmup.

You may be familiar with email manipulation with Rails so I’ll try to make this fast and simple. We first create the `order_mailer`:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails generate mailer order_mailer
----

To make it easy to test the email, we will use a gem called https://github.com/bmabey/email-spec[email_spec], it includes a bunch of useful matchers for mailers, which makes it easy and fun.

So first let’s add the gem to the `Gemfile`

[source,ruby]
.Gemfile
----
# ...
group :test do
  gem 'rspec-collection_matchers', '~> 1.1'
  gem 'rspec-rails', '~> 3.8'
  gem "email_spec"
  gem 'shoulda-matchers'
end
# ...
----

Now run the `bundle install` command to install all the dependencies. I’ll follow the documentation steps to setup the gem, you can do so on https://github.com/bmabey/email-spec#rspec[documentation]. When you are done, your `spec_helper.rb` file should look like:

[source,ruby]
.spec/rails_helper.rb
----
require File.expand_path('../config/environment', __dir__)
ENV['RAILS_ENV'] ||= 'test'
# Prevent database truncation if the environment is production
abort('The Rails environment is running in production mode!') if Rails.env.production?

require 'spec_helper'
require 'email_spec'
require 'email_spec/rspec'
require 'rspec/rails'
# ...
----

Now we can add some tests for the order mailer we created earlier:

[source,ruby]
----
# spec/mailers/order_mailer_spec.rb
require 'rails_helper'

RSpec.describe OrderMailer, type: :mailer do
  include Rails.application.routes.url_helpers

I simply copied and pasted the one from the documentation and adapt it to our needs. We now have to make sure this tests pass. First we add the action on the order mailer:

[source,ruby]
.app/mailers/order_mailer.rb
----
class OrderMailer < ApplicationMailer
  default from: 'no-reply@marketplace.com'
  def send_confirmation(order)
    @order = order
    @user = @order.user
    mail to: @user.email, subject: 'Order Confirmation'
  end
end
----

After adding this code, we now have to add the corresponding views. It is a good practice to include a text version along with the html one.

[source,erb]
----
<%# app/views/order_mailer/send_confirmation.txt.erb %>
Order: #<%= @order.id %>
You ordered <%= @order.products.count %> products:
<% @order.products.each do |product| %>
  <%= product.title %> - <%= number_to_currency product.price %>
<% end %>
----

[source,erb]
----
<!-- app/views/order_mailer/send_confirmation.html.erb -->
<h1>Order: #<%= @order.id %></h1>
<p>You ordered <%= @order.products.count %> products:</p>
<ul>
  <% @order.products.each do |product| %>
    <li><%= product.title %> - <%= number_to_currency product.price %></li>
  <% end %>
</ul>
----

Now if we run the mailer specs, they should be all green:

[source,bash]
----
$ rspec spec/mailers/order_mailer_spec.rb
.....

Finished in 0.24919 seconds (files took 0.75369 seconds to load)
5 examples, 0 failures
----

We just need to call the `send_confirmation` method into the create action on the orders controller:

[source,ruby]
.app/controllers/api/v1/orders_controller.rb
----
class Api::V1::OrdersController < ApplicationController
  # ...
  def create
    order = current_user.orders.build(order_params)

    if order.save
      OrderMailer.send_confirmation(order).deliver
      render json: order, status: 201, location: [:api, current_user, order]
    else
      render json: { errors: order.errors }, status: 422
    end
  end
  # ...
end
----

To make sure we did not break anything on the orders, we can just run the specs from the orders controller:

[source,bash]
----
$ rspec spec
..................................................................................................

Finished in 1.82 seconds (files took 0.78532 seconds to load)
98 examples, 0 failures
----

Let’s finish this section by commiting this:

[source,bash]
----
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Adds order confirmation mailer"
----

=== Conclusion

Hey you made it!, give yourself an applause, I know it’s been a long way now, but you are almost done, believe me!.

On chapters to come we will keep working on the `Order` model to add some validations when placing an order, some scenarios are:

[arabic]
. What happens when the products are not available?
. Decrement the current product quantity when an order is placed

Next chapter will be short but is really important for the sanity of the app, so don’t skip it.

After http://apionrails.icalialabs.com/book/chapter_nine#cha-chapter_nine[chapter 9], we will focus on optimization, pagination and some other cool stuff that will definitely help you build a better app.
